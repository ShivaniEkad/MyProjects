<h2 id="What_Is_An_End_User_License_Agreement">What is an End User License Agreement?</h2>
<p>An EULA is a specific<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>contract</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>between the software creator, developer, or publisher, and the individual end user who purchases the software. The contract gives the user a right to<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>use</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>a copy of the app or software in a specific way, subject to clear<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>conditions</strong>.</p>
<p>The end user can't download or install the software copy<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>until they agree</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>to these conditions of use. In other words, think of an EULA like a rental agreement. The<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>user pays to use the software</strong>, but the developer<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>still owns it</strong>.</p>
<p>This is important because there's a<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>common misconception</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>that end users "own" their copy of your app. People often assume that when they buy something, it belongs to them. However, all the end user has is a<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>functioning copy</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>of your software - not rights to the software itself.</p>

<p>Essentially, if you make your technology available for public use, then you have a need for an EULA.</p>
<p>So, for example, if you're a<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>video game company</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>that supports online gaming, or you're a<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>developer</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>and you've made an app available on the Apple App Store, you should have an EULA.</p>
